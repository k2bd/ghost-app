# WIP 2D Ghost App

This is the frontend code for my [2D Ghost App](https://ghost.k2bd.dev). It's still early days development.

## Getting started

After first checking out, install dependencies with `yarn install`.

To run a local version of the app, pointing to a locally running [API](https://github.com/k2bd/ghost-api):
```
REACT_APP_GHOST_API_URL="http://127.0.0.1:8000/" yarn start
```
